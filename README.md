A cutting-edge non-custodial Bitcoin wallet with advanced Lightning Network capabilities, designed for seamless and secure cryptocurrency transactions.

Features
Self-custodial Bitcoin wallet: Complete control over your private keys

Lightning Network support: Fast, low-cost transactions using the Lightning Network

No KYC required: Privacy-preserving wallet that doesn't require identity verification

Cross-platform: Works on desktop and mobile browsers

Current Implementation Status
Working
✅ Wallet creation and restoration using seed phrases
✅ Mock Bitcoin transactions for testing
✅ Lightning Network toggle functionality
✅ Creating Lightning invoices (receiving payments)
✅ Basic wallet interface with transaction history

Backend:

- Express.js server: Running on Node.js, handling API routes and requests
- In-memory storage (MemStorage): A non-persistent database that stores wallet data, transactions, and Lightning Network information in memory
- LNBits API integration: For Lightning Network functionality (creating invoices and making payments)

Known Limitations

Lightning Network Invoices
⚠️ Important: Currently, Lightning invoices generated by this wallet may not be properly payable by some Lightning wallets. This is due to a limitation with private nodes in the Lightning Network.

Technical explanation:

Invoices created by private Lightning nodes (like the ones used in this wallet) need to include additional routing information called "route hints"
Without these route hints, other Lightning wallets cannot establish a payment route to the node
This is a known challenge with the Lightning Network protocol, not a bug in the wallet

Future improvements:

Integration with a more comprehensive Lightning Network service that provides proper route hints
Improved error handling for failed Lightning payments
Support for additional Lightning payment options

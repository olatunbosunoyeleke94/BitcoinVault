Known Limitations

Lightning Network Invoices
⚠️ Important: Currently, Lightning invoices generated by this wallet may not be properly payable by some Lightning wallets. This is due to a limitation with private nodes in the Lightning Network.

Technical explanation:

Invoices created by private Lightning nodes (like the ones used in this wallet) need to include additional routing information called "route hints"
Without these route hints, other Lightning wallets cannot establish a payment route to the node
This is a known challenge with the Lightning Network protocol, not a bug in the wallet

Future improvements:

Integration with a more comprehensive Lightning Network service that provides proper route hints
Improved error handling for failed Lightning payments
Support for additional Lightning payment options
